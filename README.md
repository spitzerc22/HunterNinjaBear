                 As my first project, I present 'Hunter, Ninja, Bear!'.
    
    This is, pretty much, a test to see what I've learned from HTML, CSS, UX/UI and JavaScript. 

    Similar concept of 'Rock, Paper, Scissors'. At the home page, includes title, along with 'Let's Play' and 'How to Play'.

        'Let's Play' should bring you to the game field, where you are given your 3 options, also portraying each(you, the user, and the computer's) score. When one of the img's is clicked upon, it runs an eventListner which hides the current layout, and displays the winner page. 

        This will then portray what you picked, and then the computer choice (randomnized with Math.random() including a swtich/case). The //function// runs, comparing the 2 choices, logging who wins(or if it's a tie) to the console, and displaying in the game field who won, or if it's a tie!

        You are given the option to try again when the 'Play Again' button is clicked, as your scores should be stagnet until page is refreshed, or refreshed button is clicked. 

        'How to Play' is a button that has a 'click' eventListener. A pop up box should appear when clicked upon with a breif description on the game (what the buttons do, objective, little diagram of who beats what). **this button should be accessible both on the home page and the game-field page. **

        Who beats what: HUNTER beats BEAR | BEAR beats NINJA | NINJA beats HUNTER

            **ALL ADVICE IS ENCOURAGED TO IMPROVE MY GAME AND TO IMPROVE ME**
